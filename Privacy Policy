This Privacy Policy explains how **Shitposter** (the “App”) handles your information. By using the App, you agree to this Policy.

---

## 1. What We Collect

Shitposter is designed for fun and entertainment. We only collect the minimum data needed to make the App work:

* **Discord user IDs and server IDs** (for identifying users/servers where features are used).
* **Messages and commands you send to the bot** (only for the purpose of responding; we do not permanently store message content unless explicitly required for a feature).
* **Optional settings or preferences** you configure within Shitposter.

We do **not** sell or share your personal information.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Data

We use the collected data to:

* Run commands and provide the App’s features.
* Improve functionality and performance.
* Prevent abuse, spam, or misuse of the App.

---

## 3. Data Storage & Retention

* Most data is processed **temporarily** and not stored long-term.
* If the App includes settings or server configurations, these may be stored until you reset or delete them.
* We do not store your messages permanently unless required for a specific feature (and if so, we’ll make that clear).

---

## 4. Sharing Data

We do not share your data with third parties, except:

* If required by law.
* If necessary to protect the safety, rights, or integrity of users and the App.

---

## 5. Your Choices

* You can remove the App from your server at any time.
* If you want stored data (like server settings) deleted, you may contact us at \[insert email/Discord].

---

## 6. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your information. But remember: no system is 100% secure, especially on the internet. Use Shitposter responsibly.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

Shitposter is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required by Discord in your country). If you are under that age, do not use the App.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top.

---

## 9. Contact

If you have questions, concerns, or requests about your data, contact the developer(s) of Shitposter via \[insert email/Discord support channel].
